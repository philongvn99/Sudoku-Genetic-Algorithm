# Sudoku-Genetic-Algorithm
## Overview:
- This Repository has 2 python file of generate a Sudoku solver be using Generic algorithm, you can review it through AI e-book (Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach (3rd Edition))\
- One is sudoku.py that is from repository I reference to [brian-rieder's github](https://github.com/brian-rieder/genetic-sudoku) \
- One is my program is generate base of upper's program

## Properties of Sudoku Solver:
- Size: N * N * N * N (N is integer > 1) for us to always have N * N square size N * N in Sudoku board
- Goal Board: solution of Program generated automatically and differently in each time of run
- Puzzle Board: problem to solve, is generated by select a number of empty cell in Goal Board, we also create a Removal Board with same size and 0 
values to note which position is vacated (assign 0 in Puzzle one and 1 in Removal one) 
- Population size: K as number of child board used as population in Genetic algorithm
- Fitness Function: calculate how many missing cell by processing through N*N squares, rows, columns;
- Crossover Operator: swap a few cells of 2 boards, cell and board are selected by programer defination, most of boards have to been excecuted
- Mutation: replace arbitrary cell by another value in [1, N] to make some difference from current available structure of board (as **mutation** in GENE)
- Checksquare Function: check whether a cell is good by wonder row, column, square accross it all have **fitness function value** of 0 

My program looks similar to the sample's in structure but they still has some difference in content:
- Approach:
  - The sample initialize **population** by *keeping empty cells as zero value*; in my part, I replace them by arbitrary value in [1, N]  
- Crossover Operator:
  - My program select arbitrary cell and then swap column & row accross that cell, 2 board is choosen has best **fitness function value** among left board (which has been chosen will be note);
  Instead of only swap 1 cell at one time in samples's
- Mutation:
  - Sample program, be for checksquare, would replace `current value` of cell by `(current value % N * N) + 1`; in my own, I find which value is missed in row, column and square accroos that cell and random 1 

The sample approach looks more stable than mine so its time-run of solving always in same range of time :(
